# TSUNAMI DETECTION BY ML
Our work focusses on Tsunami detection by considering the geophysical and bio-system parameters.This solution uses an integrated sensor network which senses four major parameters namely Magnetic Field, Tide level, consequent  underwater Sea turtle count followed by the their navigation direction. We use an integrated dataset describing Unusual sea animal behavioural response to multiple geophysical factors related to tsunami Engineering.
What is the need for this prediction? Well , seismic disturbances at both land and water sea bed have caused severe damage to life and property in past. Various studies have come up with real time predictions thus , helping people to become aware of the unexpected agitations and prepare themselves to withstand them.In this way , loss of living beings or property can be reduced to a certain extent.
Tsunami is a series of waves caused by undersea volcanic eruptions.The best approach would involve tracking and recording the aquatic animal response for real-time predictions. Such responses have been recorded  in  terms  of  terrestrial  animal  reactions  such  as hearing range impairment, locomotive activities, nesting and breeding unusual patterns and migratory changes.
# COMPONENTS OF THE MODEL:
# Magnetic Sensor 
Tsunami is characterised by magnetic field disturbances in which secondary  induced magnetic field  is  generated due to induced electric current by Tsunami Flow. 
# Motion Sensor 
The motion sensor in the system proposed here is used to tap direction of sea turtles in terms  of  latitude and longitude along the coast of the Ocean.
# Tide Gauge
Tide gauges provide valuable information about tsunami arrival times , and such sensors observe the changes in water level due to tsunami.
# Count Sensor
This sensor is used to detect the number of turtles at a given location as tapped by other sensors discussed above. Sea turtle navigation dataset in terms of latitude and longitude, nesting or animal count along with timestamp are obtained along Indian Ocean. 
# METHOD OF PREDICTION:
Merged Dataset based on the previously studied parameters are integrated based on timestamp.We apply three major prediction algorithms Linear regression, decision tree learning and Logistic model  trees to categorise the critical features and produce predictive results.
